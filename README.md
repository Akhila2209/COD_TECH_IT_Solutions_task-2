Overview on fsm:
Finite State Machines (FSMs) are mathematical models used to design and represent systems with a limited number of specific states. They are widely used in computer science, electrical engineering, and related fields to describe the behavior of digital systems, software algorithms, and various types of processes.

### Key Components of FSMs

1. *States*: Distinct configurations that a system can be in. For example, a traffic light system might have states like Red, Green, and Yellow.

2. *Transitions*: Rules that determine how the system moves from one state to another based on inputs or conditions.

3. *Input Symbols*: External inputs that influence state transitions.

4. *Initial State*: The state in which the system starts.

5. *Final States*: States where the system can halt or complete a process (mainly in non-looping FSMs).

### Types of FSMs

1. *Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)*: Every state has exactly one transition for each possible input. The system is predictable and has no ambiguity.

2. *Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)*: States can have multiple transitions for the same input, or even transitions without input (epsilon transitions). NFAs can be converted to equivalent DFAs.

3. *Mealy Machine*: Outputs are determined by both the current state and the current input.

4. *Moore Machine*: Outputs are determined solely by the current state.

### Applications

1. *Digital Circuit Design*: Used to design sequential logic circuits like flip-flops, counters, and control units.

2. *Software Engineering*: Employed in lexical analyzers, parsers, and various types of controllers in software applications.

3. *Network Protocols*: Model communication protocols to ensure they follow predefined sequences of states and transitions.

4. *Game Development*: Manage different states in games, such as player states (running, jumping, attacking) and game states (main menu, playing, paused).

5. *Robotics*: Control the states of a robot, such as idle, moving, and performing tasks.

### Example

Consider a simple turnstile FSM:
- *States*: Locked, Unlocked
- *Input Symbols*: Coin, Push
- *Transitions*:
  - From Locked to Unlocked on Coin
  - From Unlocked to Locked on Push

Initial state: Locked

When a coin is inserted into the turnstile (input: Coin), it transitions from Locked to Unlocked. When someone pushes the turnstile (input: Push), it transitions from Unlocked to Locked.

### Advantages

1. *Simplicity*: Easy to understand and implement.
2. *Predictability*: Clear rules govern state transitions, making the system's behavior predictable.
3. *Formal Verification*: FSMs can be formally verified for correctness.

### Limitations

1. *Scalability*: Can become complex and hard to manage as the number of states grows.
2. *Memory Usage*: Requires memory to store state information, which can be costly for large FSMs.

### Conclusion

Finite State Machines are fundamental tools in various fields for modeling systems with a finite number of states and well-defined transitions. Their simplicity and clarity make them powerful for designing predictable and verifiable systems, though they can become complex with an increasing number of states and transitions.
